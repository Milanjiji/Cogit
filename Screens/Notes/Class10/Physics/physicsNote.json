        "note1":"Electric current is the flow of electric charges through a conductor. It is measured in amperes (A) and is denoted by the symbol 'I'. When a conductor is connected to a battery, the battery provides a potential difference, which causes the electric charges to flow through the conductor.",
        "note2":"Electric potential is the amount of electric potential energy per unit charge. It is measured in volts (V) and is denoted by the symbol 'V'. The potential difference between two points is the difference in electric potential between those points. It is also measured in volts and is denoted by the symbol 'V'.",

It is expressed as V = IR, where V is the potential difference across the conductor, I is the current flowing through the conductor, and R is the resistance of the conductor.",
        "note5":"Resistance is the opposition of a material to the flow of electric charges. It is measured in ohms (Ω) and is denoted by the symbol 'R'. Materials with high resistance are called insulators, while materials with low resistance are called conductors.  ",
        "note6":"Resistivity is a measure of how well a material resists the flow of electric charges. It is denoted by the symbol ρ and is measured in ohm-metres (Ωm). Resistivity depends on the type of material, its temperature, and other physical conditions.",
        
        "example1":"For example, when you switch on a light bulb, the current flows through the filament of the bulb, which then heats up and produces light.",

The chapter explains how electric currents can produce magnetic fields and how these magnetic fields can produce forces on other moving charges. It also introduces the concept of electromagnetic induction and how it is used in various devices.",

        "note1": "A magnetic field is a region in which a magnetic force is experienced by magnetic objects or moving electric charges. Magnetic fields are represented by magnetic field lines that show the direction and strength of the field at different points.",
        "note2": "A current-carrying conductor produces a magnetic field around it. The direction of the magnetic field is given by the right-hand thumb rule, which states that if the thumb of the right hand points in the direction of the current, then the fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines.",
        "note3": "The right-hand thumb rule is a method used to determine the direction of the magnetic field around a current-carrying conductor.",
        "note4": "The magnetic field due to a current through a straight conductor can be calculated using Ampere's circuital law. The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the conductor.",
        "note5": "A current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force called the Lorentz force. The direction of the force is given by Fleming's left-hand rule, which states that if the first finger, second finger, and thumb of the left hand are held perpendicular to each other with the first finger pointing in the direction of the magnetic field, the second finger pointing in the direction of the current, then the thumb will point in the direction of the force experienced by the conductor.",
        "note6": "An electric motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. It works on the principle of the interaction between a magnetic field and an electric current. An electric motor consists of a coil of wire (armature) that rotates in a magnetic field, causing a torque to be exerted on the armature, which in turn rotates a shaft and produces mechanical energy.",

        "example1": "For example, a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it, which can be visualized using iron filings that align themselves with the magnetic field lines.",
        "example2": "For example, a current-carrying wire wrapped around a compass needle causes the needle to deflect, indicating the presence of a magnetic field around the wire.",
        "example3": "For example, if the current in a wire flows from south to north, then the magnetic field lines will be in the direction of a clockwise spiral around the wire.",
        "example4": "For example, if a current-carrying wire is bent into a loop, the magnetic field inside the loop is uniform and parallel to the axis of the loop.",
        "example5": "For example, an electromagnetic induction experiment can be performed by moving a magnet through a coil of wire, which induces a current in the wire due to the changing magnetic field. This phenomenon is used in generators and transformers to convert electrical energy into other forms of energy.",

        "note1": "Reflection is the bouncing back of light from a surface. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.",
        "note2": "The laws of reflection state that the incident ray, reflected ray, and the normal to the surface at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.",
        "note3": "A spherical mirror is a mirror whose reflecting surface is a part of a sphere. It can be of two types - concave and convex. The center of curvature, radius of curvature, and principal axis are important terms related to spherical mirrors.",
        "note4": "A concave mirror is a spherical mirror in which the reflecting surface is curved inward. It can form both real and virtual images depending upon the position of the object. The focal length of a concave mirror is positive. A convex mirror is a spherical mirror in which the reflecting surface is curved outward. It always forms a virtual image, and the focal length of a convex mirror is negative.",
        "note5": "Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another. The bending of light depends upon the refractive indices of the two media and the angle of incidence.",
        "note6": "The laws of refraction state that the incident ray, refracted ray, and the normal to the surface at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane. The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is constant for a given pair of media and is called the refractive index.",
        "note7": "A lens is a transparent material bounded by two curved surfaces, or one curved and one plane surface.",
        "note8":" It can be of two types - converging and diverging. The focal length, optical center, and principal axis are important terms related to lenses. A converging lens is thicker in the middle and thinner at the edges. It forms real and virtual images depending on the position of the object. The focal length of a converging lens is positive. A diverging lens is thinner in the middle and thicker at the edges. It always forms virtual images, and the focal length of a diverging lens is negative.",

        "example1":"For example, the reflection of light from a plane mirror is an example of regular reflection because the reflected rays remain parallel to each other.",
        "example2":"For example, a convex mirror is used as a rearview mirror in vehicles because it gives a wider field of view.",
        "example3":"If you've ever looked into a mirror, you've seen a spherical mirror in action! Mirrors have a reflective surface that is part of a sphere, and the image you see is a reflection of the light that bounces off the mirror. Concave mirrors (like those found in shaving or makeup mirrors) curve inward, and can focus light to create a magnified image. Convex mirrors (like those found in a car's side mirrors) curve outward, and can widen the field of view.",
        "example4":"Concave Mirror:Examples include makeup mirrors, shaving mirrors, and satellite dish antennas. Convex Mirrors :Examples include car side mirrors, security mirrors in stores, and some decorative mirrors.",
        "example5":"For example When you place a straw in a glass of water, it appears bent or broken. This is because the light passing through the straw bends or refracts as it enters the water, due to the change in speed between air and water. Our eyes then perceive the light as coming from a different direction than it actually is, causing the straw to appear bent or broken.",
        "example6":"When light enters a different medium, it changes direction. The laws of refraction describe this change. The first law states that the incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane. The second law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is constant for a given pair of media. For example, when a pencil is placed in a glass of water, it appears bent due to the laws of refraction.",
        "example7":"Spherical lenses are another example of how light changes direction when it passes through a different medium. When light passes through a convex lens, it converges to a point known as the focal point. When it passes through a concave lens, it diverges. This is because the curved surface of the lens bends the light rays and changes their direction. For example, eyeglasses work by using a convex lens to correct farsightedness, allowing the focal point to fall on the retina.",
        "example8":"Convex lens: a magnifying glass, a camera lens, a telescope lens. Concave lens: eyeglasses for nearsightedness, peephole lenses in doors, some types of binoculars.",

It consists of various parts like the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina, etc. The cornea and the lens help in focusing the light on the retina. The retina contains photoreceptor cells called rods and cones, which convert the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain through the optic nerve.",
        "note2":"The ability of the human eye to adjust its focus on objects at different distances is called the power of accommodation. This is made possible by the contraction and relaxation of the ciliary muscles, which change the shape of the lens to adjust the focus.",
        "note3":"A prism is a triangular piece of glass that can refract light. When a beam of white light passes through a prism, it gets refracted and splits into its component colors, forming a spectrum.",
        "note4":"Dispersion is the process of splitting white light into its component colors. This is possible because different colors of light have different wavelengths and hence refract at different angles when passing through a medium like a prism.",
        "note5":"When light passes through a medium containing particles, it gets scattered in different directions. This is known as scattering of light. This is why the sky appears blue during the day, as the blue light gets scattered more than other colors.",
        "note6":"When light passes through the atmosphere, it undergoes refraction due to the varying densities of the different layers of the atmosphere. This can cause various optical illusions like the apparent displacement of the sun during sunrise and sunset.",

The main fossil fuels are coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These fuels are used extensively for generating electricity, powering vehicles, and heating buildings. However, burning fossil fuels releases harmful gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and air pollution.",
        "note2":"Biofuels are renewable sources of energy that come from organic matter such as wood, crops, and waste. The most common biofuels are bioethanol and biodiesel, which are used as substitutes for gasoline and diesel fuel. Biofuels are considered to be a greener alternative to fossil fuels as they emit fewer greenhouse gases and are less harmful to the environment.",
        "note3":"Wind energy is harnessed by using wind turbines to generate electricity. Wind turbines consist of large blades attached to a rotor that spins when the wind blows. This rotational energy is then converted into electrical energy using a generator. Wind energy is a clean, renewable source of energy that does not produce greenhouse gases or other pollutants.",
        "note4":"Solar energy is the energy that is harnessed from the sun. Solar panels are used to convert sunlight into electricity by using photovoltaic cells. These cells are made of materials such as silicon, which absorb photons from the sun and convert them into electrons, creating an electrical current. Solar energy is a clean and renewable source of energy that does not produce greenhouse gases or other pollutants.",
        "note5":"Hydro energy is the energy that is harnessed from water. This is done by using a hydroelectric dam, which is built across a river or other water source. The dam traps the water, creating a reservoir that can be used to generate electricity. When the water is released from the dam, it flows through turbines that generate electricity. Hydro energy is a clean and renewable source of energy that does not produce greenhouse gases or other pollutants.",
        "note6":"Nuclear energy is harnessed by using nuclear reactors to generate electricity. Nuclear reactors work by using the heat generated by nuclear fission, which is the process of splitting atoms. This heat is then used to produce steam, which powers a turbine to generate electricity. Nuclear energy is a controversial source of energy due to safety concerns and the potential for nuclear accidents, but it is also a clean source of energy that does not produce greenhouse gases or other pollutants.",
        "note7":"Geothermal energy is harnessed by using the heat that is generated from the earth's core. This is done by drilling deep into the earth's surface to access the heat, which is then used to produce steam to power turbines and generate electricity.
